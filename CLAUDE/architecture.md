# Architecture

## Layered Design

```
Compute Engine (Spark, Flink, DuckDB, Polars, ...)
  -> Your Delta Connector (implements compute engine's DataSource API)
    -> Delta Kernel operation
      -> Workflow/Generator coroutine -> connector-owned driver -> I/O and compute
      -> Engine compatibility adapter -> Engine handlers -> I/O and compute
```

Kernel handles the Delta protocol through ordinary runtime-neutral Rust futures; connectors handle
execution, distribution, and data flow. On the connector-driven path, workflows and generators
combine those futures with typed request/reply channels. Kernel awaits connector work instead of
invoking connector operations. A connector may drive the same coroutine synchronously without an
async runtime, one request at a time on its executor, or with concurrent request handling. Replies
wake an async driver but never poll Kernel.

Engine-based entry points use a synchronous compatibility driver inside Kernel. It polls the same
protocol futures and translates each request into a call to the corresponding `Engine` handler.

Kernel leaves columnar memory representation and I/O scheduling to the connector. For example,
during log replay or checkpoint writes, kernel receives opaque `EngineData` batches, inspects them
via the visitor pattern, updates a selection vector, and hands them back without deserializing the
full batch into in-memory structs.

## Snapshot

`Snapshot` (`kernel/src/snapshot/`) is the primary entry point for operations on an existing table.
It is an immutable point-in-time view of a Delta table at a specific version, providing the table
schema, metadata, properties, and version number.

Built via `Snapshot::builder_for(url).build(engine)` (latest version) or
`.at_version(v).build(engine)` (specific version). For catalog-managed tables,
`.with_log_tail(commits)` supplies recent unpublished commits from the catalog and
`.with_max_catalog_version(v)` caps the snapshot at the latest catalog-ratified version.
`Snapshot::builder_from(snapshot)` returns an `IncrementalSnapshotBuilder` that reuses the input
snapshot. Its opt-in `skip_new_checkpoints()` mode keeps the input checkpoint and every commit in
the update window so a snapshot-derived `CommitRange` can inspect them without another log
listing.
Under `internal-api`, `.with_snapshot_hint(hint)` constructs a snapshot without engine log I/O.
Kernel validates structural consistency; the connector owns table-root membership,
protocol/metadata provenance, `max_published_version`, and freshness.

**Snapshot loading internals:**
1. Ordinary builds discover commits and checkpoints through **LogSegment**
   (`kernel/src/log_segment/`) and resolve Protocol and Metadata through CRC state or log replay.
   Domain metadata is resolved lazily from CRC state or log replay when queried. Snapshot-hint
   builds validate and assemble the supplied state instead.
2. **Log replay** (`kernel/src/log_replay/`): file-action deduplication via
   `FileActionDeduplicator` and `LogReplayProcessor` trait (distinct from Protocol/Metadata
   replay above)

From a snapshot you can: read the schema and table properties, build a `Scan` to read data,
start a `Transaction` to write data, or create a checkpoint.

## Read Path

`Snapshot` -> `ScanBuilder` -> `Scan` -> data

The scan pipeline: log replay (build active file list) -> data skipping (prune files via stats
and partition values) -> file reading -> physical-to-logical transform (partition values,
column mapping, schema evolution) -> deletion vector filtering.

**Key modules** (`kernel/src/scan/`): `log_replay.rs` (reconcile Add/Remove into active file
set), `data_skipping.rs` (rewrite predicates against min/max/nullCount stats and partition values).

**Execution paths:**
- `scan.execute(engine)`: kernel handles everything end-to-end, returns `EngineData`
- `scan.scan_metadata(engine)`: returns file list + transforms; connector reads files and
  calls `transform_to_logical` / `DvInfo::get_selection_vector`
- `scan.parallel_scan_metadata(engine)`: two-phase distributed log replay (requires the
  `internal-api` feature)

**Incremental read:** `Snapshot::incremental_scan_builder(base_version)` streams the file-action
diff over `(base_version, target_version]`: live Adds as a `FilteredEngineData` iterator
plus a terminal summary of live Add and Remove file keys. Use this to advance a cached
file listing without re-scanning the table.

## Write Path

`Snapshot` -> `Transaction` -> (`WriteState` -> `BoundWriteContextBuilder` ->
`BoundWriteContext`) -> commit

Kernel captures table-wide configuration in a transportable `WriteState`. Each writer binds
partition values and any logical materialized row-tracking columns to create a `BoundWriteContext`
containing validated partition values, data schemas, statistics columns, and the recommended write
directory. The transaction registers the resulting files, enforces protocol compliance, assembles
commit actions, and emits a prepared `Commit` request. The connector delegates that request to the
selected committer workflow.

**Data-write steps:**
1. Create a `TransactionWithCommitter` from a snapshot
2. Call `txn.write_state()` after configuring the transaction, then use
   `WriteState::write_context_builder()` to bind partition values and build a `BoundWriteContext`.
   Distributed writers can encode the state and decode it on each worker before binding partition
   values.
3. Write Parquet files (via engine), collect file metadata
4. Register files via `txn.add_files(metadata)` and stage any removals or deletion-vector updates
5. Commit: returns the `CommitResult` and committer together so every outcome retains the
   committer for retry or catalog publish

- **Transaction** (`kernel/src/transaction/`): blind append writes, file removals, deletion-vector
  updates, table creation (including clustered tables via `DataLayout`), and limited schema
  evolution
- **Committer** (`kernel/src/committer/`): commit coordination. `FileSystemCommitter` provides a
  path-based workflow; the `Committer` trait is the Engine compatibility API.
- **Coroutine runtime** (`kernel/src/coroutine/`): runtime-neutral protocol futures plus typed
  request/reply channels. Connectors drive workflows or construct `StaticGenerator` values with
  `StaticGenerator::new`. Kernel code with an existing `Channel` calls async workflow
  implementations directly and consumes streams through `Generator::next`, causing child requests
  to surface from the parent coroutine. Drivers may serve requests synchronously, one at a time
  using async I/O, or concurrently, and complete each request's reply.

## Engine Trait System

The `Engine` trait (`kernel/src/lib.rs`) is the synchronous compatibility interface. It provides the
required handlers below and an optional `PlanExecutor` under the `declarative-plans` feature:

| Handler              | Purpose                          | Key Methods                                |
|----------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `StorageHandler`     | File system operations           | `list_from`, `read_files`, etc.            |
| `JsonHandler`        | Delta log commit parsing/writing | `parse_json`, `read_json_files`            |
| `ParquetHandler`     | Data file and checkpoint I/O     | `read_parquet_files`, `write_parquet_file`  |
| `EvaluationHandler`  | Expression/predicate evaluation  | `new_expression_evaluator`, etc.           |

Metrics are emitted as tracing events and collected by tracing layers. `DefaultEngine` (Arrow +
`object_store` + Tokio) implements this interface. `AsyncEngineConnector` in the same crate serves
one coroutine request at a time through native async I/O without `Engine` or its `TaskExecutor`.
Custom Engine implementations remain available for existing compatibility integrations; new
connectors that need custom behavior should drive coroutine requests directly.

## EngineData Trait

Kernel never assumes data is Arrow. It uses the `EngineData` trait: an opaque columnar data
interface. The kernel extracts data via a visitor pattern (`visit_rows` with typed `GetData`
accessors), not by inspecting columns directly. Never downcast `EngineData` to a concrete type
(e.g. `ArrowEngineData`) in prod kernel code: only the connector implementation that owns the data
knows its concrete type. (Unit tests using the default engine may legitimately downcast.)

`DefaultEngine` uses `ArrowEngineData` (wrapping Arrow `RecordBatch`). Connector-driven request
handlers may implement `EngineData` for their native columnar representation.

Key methods: `visit_rows`, `len`, `append_columns` (for partition value injection/column mapping),
`apply_selection_vector` (for deletion vectors).

**IMPORTANT:** Never assume that reading one file produces exactly one batch. Always iterate over
all returned batches: the connector's reader may split a single file across multiple batches.

## Catalog-Managed Tables

Tables whose commits go through a catalog (e.g. Unity Catalog) instead of direct filesystem
writes. Kernel doesn't know catalog APIs: the catalog client provides a log tail via
`SnapshotBuilder::with_log_tail()`, caps the version via `with_max_catalog_version()`, and
uses a catalog workflow for staging, ratifying, and publishing commits. Engine-based connectors use
a custom `Committer` as a compatibility adapter.

The `UCCommitter` (in the `delta-kernel-unity-catalog` crate) is the reference implementation of a
catalog committer for Unity Catalog. It writes version 0 directly to `_delta_log/`. For later
versions, it stages commits in `_staged_commits/`, calls the UC commit API to ratify them, and
publishes them by atomically copying them to `_delta_log/`. Its connector-owned commit task consumes
catalog requests. A staged JSON write carries the commit-action generator, whose kernel requests
are driven by the connector performing the write.

For versions after 0, commit types are staged (written to `_staged_commits/`), ratified (accepted
by the catalog for a version), and published (copied to `_delta_log/` as a normal Delta file).
